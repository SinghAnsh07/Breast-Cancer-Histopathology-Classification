## Breast Cancer Histopathology Classification (BreaKHis)

This project trains Vision Transformer (ViT) models to classify
benign vs malignant breast cancer histopathology images using the
BreaKHis dataset across multiple magnifications.

### Features
- Multi-magnification training (40X–400X)
- Vision Transformer (ViT-Small)
- Data augmentation & cosine LR scheduling
- Robust handling of missing magnification data
- Google Colab compatible

### Note
The notebook is provided as source code only.
Training outputs and models are generated during execution.
